# Face Detection System

# In this system, with the help of the OpenCV library, we will be giving access to the camera of your device and then with the help of the camera, we will be detecting the face. In the camera, if the face is present then it will show a hollow square around the face and if the face will not be visible it will not show the hollow square.

# for detecting process we used the haarcascade algorithm
